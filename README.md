TAR Archiver for C# / .NET
==========================

Minimal C# implementation for creating TAR (.tar) archive file.


This library is built based on the codes from [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress) library with:

- `unsafe` Context Removal
    - `Span<T> = stackalloc T` Remain Untouched &nbsp; <small>* Require C# 7.3 or Later</small>
- Nullables Removal
- `System.Buffers` Dependency Removal
- Unity Ready without additional DLL Installation
- Support for Unity Package Manager

`TarStream` を開いて string、byte[] または Stream を書き込むだけで tar アーカイブが作れます。`System.IO.Compression` と組み合わせて `.tar.gz`（`.tgz`）も作成できます。

</details>


Not complicated. The only feature is creating TAR archive from `string`, `byte[]` or `Stream` without any temporary file creation.

Thanks to `System.IO.Compression` library, you can also create `.tar.gz` (`.tgz`) archive on the fly.



```csharp
using SatorImaging.TarArchiver;
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.IO.Compression;

public class Sample
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        if (args.Length == 0 || string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(args[0]))
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(args));

        // open TAR stream and export as a .tar.gz format
        using (var targz = new FileStream(args[0], FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write))
        using (var gzip = new GZipStream(targz, CompressionLevel.Optimal))
        using (var tar = new TarStream(gzip))
        {
            // writing data
            tar.Write(@"path/to/the/file.txt", @"Hello, World.");
            tar.Write(@"path/with/multibyte/文字列.txt", @"ひらがなカタカナ漢字");
            tar.Write(@"yet-another-folder/byteArray.txt", new byte[] { 84, 65, 82, 13, 10 });  //TAR[CR][LF]
            tar.Write(@"root.txt", "");
            tar.Flush();  // done in TarStream.Dispose() anyway
        }

    }
}
```
